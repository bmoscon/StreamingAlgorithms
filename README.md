A Set of Streaming Algorithms. Types include:

* Bloom Filters
   * Basic
   * Counting
   * Spectral

* Count-Min Sketch

* Karp-Papadimitriou-Shenker

* Misra-Gries

* Space Saving/Stream Summary



Majority are in C++ (one is in python and Go) and plans are in place to port all to Python, Ruby, Java, Scala and Go.


The C++ implementations use templated classes, and are single header files. To use, simply include the header file - no make files or anything similar.
