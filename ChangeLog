November 15, 2016:
        * Save and Load methods added to StreamSummary in Python. These methods allow the user to save the state of the StreamSummary
	  object to JSON, and to load the state from JSON

November 17, 2015:
        * New python implementation of StreamSummary. Significantly more efficient and a lot cleaner (analagous to C++ version).
        * New unit pytests for StreamSummary
        
September 14, 2015:
	* Moved code from GoStream repo to this repo. No reason to have a separate 
          repo for a single language, when this already includes multiple languages

September 28, 2013:
	* fixed various bugs in StreamSummary, added destructor, etc
	* ported stream summary to python

September 2, 2013:
	* Fixed bug in bucket logic that was causing an assert
	* Checking return value of all insertions now

March 30, 2013:
	* StreamSummary
	- Added unordered_map to Bucket class to avoid O(n) search for object to remove from bucket.
	  This uses more memory, but its probably an ok tradeoff for speed.

	* BloomFilter
	- Added two new methods and a new constuctor. No longer necessary to pass a vector
	  of function pointers to constructor; use setHash to pass a fp vector, or use
	  addHash to add individual fps to the list
