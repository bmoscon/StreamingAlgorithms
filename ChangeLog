	StreamSummary
	Added unordered_map to Bucket class to avoid O(n) search for object to remove from bucket.
	This uses more memory, but its probably an ok tradeoff for speed.

	BloomFilter
	Added two new methods and a new constuctor. No longer necessary to pass a vector
	of function pointers to constructor; use setHash to pass a fp vector, or use
	addHash to add individual fps to the list
